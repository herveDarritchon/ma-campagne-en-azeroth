# Obsidian Second Brain - Codex CLI Operating Manual — Au Nom de la Horde

This vault runs the **obsidian-second-brain** and RPG creation skills. The skill ships a set of
*commands*: each one is a multi-step instruction file that you (the Codex
agent) should follow when the user's request matches its trigger phrase.

## How to operate

1. Read `_CLAUDE.md` in the vault root, if it exists, to learn the user's
   vault conventions (folder map, daily note format, naming).
2. When the user's request matches a trigger in the tables below, read the
   matching file under `.codex/commands/<name>.md` and follow its
   instructions step by step.
3. Treat the AI-first vault rule (`_CLAUDE.md`) as
   non-negotiable for every note you write: `## For future Claude` preamble,
   rich frontmatter (`type`, `date`, `tags`, `ai-first: true`), `[[wikilinks]]`
   for every person/project/concept, recency markers per external claim,
   sources verbatim, confidence levels where applicable.
4. Do not invent commands. If no command matches, ask the user what they
   want or fall back to plain natural-language help.
5. **Design Rules (GDR):** Before generating or structuring any new RPG document (Scenario, Lore, NPC, Location, Faction, etc.), you MUST read `Design_Records/00_Index_des_Regles_de_Design.md` to find and apply the relevant formatting and design rules.
6. **Obsidian Markdown Syntax:** You MUST strictly respect the Obsidian markdown formalism. Do NOT use standard markdown variants if they differ from Obsidian's syntax (e.g., use `_..._` for italics, not `*...*`).
7. **Strict Canon & Lore Compliance (Do NOT Invent):** Before proposing ideas or creating new content, you MUST search and read the existing campaign bible, storyboards, and character files in the vault. NEVER invent new lore, timelines, or events without sourcing. Always build upon the existing history and distinguish `[Canon]`, `[Officiel]`, `[Inférence]` and `[Spéculation]`.
8. **Nomenclature WoW en Français:** Vous devez systématiquement utiliser les noms officiels en français pour toutes les créatures, lieux, personnages, factions et objets de l'univers de World of Warcraft.
